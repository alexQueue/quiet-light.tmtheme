# QuietLight.tmTheme

A [TextMate][] theme based on the [Quiet Light theme][quiet-light] for
[Espresso][].

I really like this Espresso theme and wanted to be able to use it with
TextMate.

## Installation

Just double-click or `open` the `QuietLight.tmTheme` file and TextMate will take
care of installing it for you.
